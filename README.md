# SPAIN 1940 #

### A turn-based strategy game for Android and Linux ###

The Spanish Civil War never happened, so Franco wasn't there to become Hitler's puppy.

Meanwhile, the advance across Europe continues: Poland was first, then Netherlands, Belgium and France .... 

The Nazis are at the Pyrenees and they don't look like going home..... yet

Will you be able to kick them out ?
